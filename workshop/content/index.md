The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) site describes MySQL as a:

> relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,[7] and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.

Before you can use MySQL for your applications, you need to deploy a MySQL server cluster.

In this workshop, you will learn how to create a MySQL cluster using the MySQL operator.
