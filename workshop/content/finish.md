## Percona XtraDB Mysql Cluster Operator

In this lab, we used the Percona XtraDB Cluster Operator to deplay a MySQL server cluster on OpenShift. With a managed db cluster in place, we deployed the popular WordPress Content Management System using our `pxc` resource as a backend to store WordPress's data. We experimented with how the Operator allows scaling, recovering, and manageing the database cluster in common Kubernetes terms, showing how Operators extend clusters running Kubernetes and Kubernetes distributions like OpenShift to create custom first-class API resources.
